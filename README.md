# Air-Pollution-Time-Series
Repository for Kaggle July competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-jul-2021/overview)
It is also a brief showcase on how I tend to approach a relatively simple machine learning problem 

Note that the library for EDA does not work on github, if you want to see it I suggests looking at my notebook on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/alessandrobenetti/feature-engineering-automl-with-autogluon)
